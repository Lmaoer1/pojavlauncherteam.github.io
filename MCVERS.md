# Supported Minecraft versions

With each new Minecraft release comes questions: how well does it play nice with PojavLauncher?

Thanks to the hard work from PojavLauncherTeam, both the Android and the iOS port now cover most Minecraft versions...

...with some small exceptions that will be listed below.

## Android
Current issues, as of the Edelweiss update

- Glitchy sky when using Holy Gl4es with "Classic" versions.

- The game window is much smaller on all "Classic" versions.

- Broken camera movement on all "Classic" versions except for **c.30_01c**

~~why are these all about Classic versions~~
## iOS
Current issues, as of the Deepslate update
